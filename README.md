<br>Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!<br>


What I like most about version control is that it helps me keep track of every change I make, so I can always go back if something breaks or if I make a mistake. It also makes it easy to work with others without accidentally overwriting each other’s work.


What I find most challenging about version control is that some commands and error messages can be confusing, especially when things go wrong and I’m not sure how to fix them. I also find it tricky when I have to deal with merge conflicts because they can be hard to understand.
